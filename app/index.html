    <p>
      I'm a self-taught web developer who prides herself on being able to focus not only on the details, but also on how they interact within a project as a whole. I am a creative thinker, a problem-solver, and I love nothing more than a good challenge.

      I spent close to ten years working in the planning field and have been a freelance writer and editor since 2010. As a planner, I conducted data analyses, both quantitative and qualitative. I wrote and edited reports, wrote grant proposals, designed data graphics, designed map graphics, gave public presentations, organized public participation strategies and events, and was responsible for managing one other employee. As a writer and editor I have written book reviews, essays, short stories, and articles for trade magazines. I have also edited a variety of different types of documents, including academic theses, articles, and papers; resumes; and non-fiction books.

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy writing fiction, reading, and have lately been learning about lettering, calligraphy, and typography. I volunteer as an Assistant Fiction Editor for <a href="http://review.antiochcollege.org/antioch_review/">The Antioch Review</a>, a literary journal, and I have my own blog—<a href="http://www.edgeofuncertainty.com">The Edge of Uncertainty</a>—where I review adventure books. I have a husband, two children, and two dogs and I love spending time with them, traveling, and having new adventures.
