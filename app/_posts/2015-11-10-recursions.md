<br/>I love this image. I look at it and I think of possibility and infinity and richness. It reminds me of the image below—-a print made by the artist Stefanie Posavec—-which is a visual analysis of the book **On the Road** by Jack Kerouac.

> One method I used to gather data looked closely at the basic structure of the novel. I liked the idea of visualising the structure of a novel as a living, breathing thing full of energy and vitality, and this intent was the basis of my “Literary Organism” visualisation. Here, a tree structure is used to show how Part One of the novel is split into chapters, chapters are split into paragraphs, paragraphs are split into sentences, and sentences are split into words. The outcome is a cellular, plant-like structure.

So, I suppose the only similarity is in the tree structure used to represent the two concepts. And yet, as a writer, I can't help but think about how the concept of recursion relates to the process of writing and the structure of a story. The [Wikipedia definition of recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is "a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem." It is the same with writing. The problem is always how to create suspense, how to keep the reader engaged with the story. And the solution to keeping the reader engaged through a story or a novel depends on the solution to keeping the reader engaged through a chapter, a scene, a sentence. Even a word.

I might be reaching a little, but thinking about it like this helps me understand both recursions and stories a little better. This is why I love learning. Learning about one thing almost always leads me to a better understanding of many other things, related or not.
