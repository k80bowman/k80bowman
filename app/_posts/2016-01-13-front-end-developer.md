I received my Front End Development Certification from [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) last week and I wanted to take a few moments and reflect on what that actually means.

It's definitely a milestone. It's an achievement that I can point to, that I can put on my resume.

I worked hard and I earned it. And in the seven months that it took me to finish Free Code Camp's Front End Development section, I went from knowing very little about HTML and CSS and virtually nothing about JavaScript to being able to code in HTML and CSS fairly easily and being able to build pretty complex JavaScript applications. I can now sit in on a conversation about the latest framework or the finer points of a coding language and actually understand most of what's being said. That's pretty awesome.

I've been able to build my own websites from scratch and I've even gone on to learn new tools and frameworks on my own. Lately I've been having fun with Sass and Bourbon and Neat and I've built two websites using Jekyll and served them using GitHub Pages.

It's nice being able to go from a place where I was completely lost and in the dark about everything to a place where I can get excited about learning new things and it all doesn't seem so complicated or dense.

I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn. But you know what? I'm looking forward to it. I truly am. Making the choice to expand my knowledge, to take this turn into something unknown, has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've made new friends, I've increased my level of confidence in myself, and I feel incredibly lucky to be where I am now. More than anything, though, I've reconfirmed the notion that learning something new is never a bad idea.
